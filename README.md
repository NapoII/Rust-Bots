# Rust Game Bots

This repository contains a collection of three bots for the Rust game:

    Fishing bot - A bot that automates the fishing process in the game.
    Auto sell bot - A bot that automates the selling process of items in the game.
    SeedBot - A bot that helps in writing a list with genetics of a plant.

These bots can be used to automate some of the repetitive tasks in the game, thus saving time and effort.
Requirements

The bots are built using Python 3

## Usage

#### Fishing Bot

    Run Angel_Bot.py.
    In Rust game, position your character at the fishing spot in a chair.
    Press start the bot.
    The bot will automatically fish and stop when the fishing rod breaks or the inventory is full.

#### Auto Sell Bot

    Run auto_sell_bot.py.
    In Rust game, go to the vending machine to sell items.

    The bot will automatically sell items and stop if your inventory is empty.
