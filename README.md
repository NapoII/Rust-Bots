This repository contains a collection of three bots for the Rust game:

    Fishing bot - A bot that automates the fishing process in the game.
    Auto sell bot - A bot that automates the selling process of items in the game.
    SeedBot - A bot that helps in writing a list with genetics of a plant.

These bots can be used to automate some of the repetitive tasks in the game, thus saving time and effort.
Requirements

The bots are built using Python 3

## Usage

#### Fishing Bot

    Run Angel_Bot.py.
    In Rust game, position your character at the fishing spot in a chair.
    Press start the bot.
    The bot will automatically fish and stop when the fishing rod breaks or the inventory is full.

#### Auto Sell Bot

    Run auto_sell_bot.py.
    In Rust game, go to the vending machine to sell items.
    Press start the bot.
    The bot will automatically sell items and stop if your inventory is empty.

#### SeedBot

    Run Rust-SeedBot.py.
    Put all clones in a box, open it and start the bot. It will create a text list of all the genetics

## Contributions

This project is open for contributions from anyone who is interested. Feel free to clone this repository and upgrade the bots or add new ones to automate other tasks in the game. If you make any changes, please submit a pull request and we will review it as soon as possible.
